# Climate-Informed-Development-Investigating-the-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Poverty
Assignment for ECON 676: Examines climate change and poverty in 16 nations using Stata 17 BE. Utilizes SEM and OLS regression, finding a significant correlation between CO2 emissions and poverty, with varied impacts from precipitation and agriculture. Calls for further research on environmental factors in developing economies.
This working paper, an assignment for my Development Economics course (ECON 676), focuses on a pertinent policy issue within the field of development economics, specifically examining the interplay between climate change and poverty in 16 different nations, focusing on poverty measures in developing nations. This study employs both structural equation modeling (SEM) and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to analyze data relevant to developing countries. The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between CO2 emissions and the poverty headcount ratio, alongside notable influences of precipitation and agricultural employment on poverty levels. Interestingly, variables such as agricultural value added, temperature change, and year did not exhibit statistical significance. Crucially, the paper delves into the hypothesis that CO2 emissions may serve as a 'shadow variable', indirectly reflecting other more impactful factors on poverty. The interpretation of data is central to this study, illuminating the intricate dynamics between environmental factors and poverty in the context of developing economies. The paper concludes with a call for further research into additional variables and forms of environmental degradation to deepen our understanding of these complex relationships. It underscores the necessity for ongoing research and policy interventions, highlighting the critical role of development economics in addressing contemporary global challenges. This study not only contributes to the academic discourse but also offers practical insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the developing world, aligning with the broader objectives of ECON 676 to foster a deeper understanding of real-world economic issues through the lens of empirical data and economic theory.
